  <p>
    A pretentious choice, mostly. No, it means 'fate': something to which one is bound and which 
    one bears out, will or no. It also gave us 'weird', the unusual and strange (for which a 
    synonym is 'queer'); and so too does it have phonological similarities, though no etymological
    link, to 'wired': like a computer, linked up, connected, and made part of a greater whole.
